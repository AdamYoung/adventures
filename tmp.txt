In a house by the hill where the wildflowers sway, Lived a baby and her husky who loved to play all day. -
They danced with the clouds and chased butterflies, Painting the day with the colors of skies. -
One morning they set off to see what they'd find, Through forests so lush and paths that wind. - 
They sailed on a leaf down a glistening stream, Chasing the echoes of a faraway dream -
They climbed a tall tree to see the world wide, Discovering wonders from their perch up high. -
As stars peeked out and the sun said goodnight, They headed back home by the moon's soft light.
